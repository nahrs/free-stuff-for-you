Free Stuff For You

I went to the High School Academy for Software Engineering.
I am big on opensource stuff and things so when I used do CS Homework I used to post it here, if people needed help they can ask me, or just take it I dont really care.
If I got in trouble for this, ok. I was tired of people asking me for help in class so here is a place for me to put code and if they really care about what is happening then they can ask me personally.

also if you ever get into going with less and less UI in linux I recomend getting a WM (window manager) such as i3 or sway. The i3 folder has my normally upto date config file. Dont be afraid to write your own, this is what works for me.
