i finally made my terminal not an eye sore. only took like 2 and a half years living in arch to decide its time to bite the bullet and rice it up

if you wanna copy it just move all the files except .zshrc to ~/.zsh

here are the plugins im currently using:
https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting
https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search
